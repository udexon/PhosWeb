# PhosWeb
Web Programming as Easy as 1-2-3.

The World Wide Wed has undergone tremendous changes since its inception in ...

From the first humble plain text web page at info.cern.ch, to today's literally billions of pages delivered to users' mobile devices and desktop computers, the web is truly the most significant technological presence in human societies, succeeding the roles of the television.Â 

It is powering the biggest tech companies, led by the top 5 we collectively coin as MAGA+F (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook), employing millions of programmers world wide, lifting a whole generation of people from poverty, some of them now leading the likes of MAGA+F.

Yet, the complexities introduced in the tools in programming the web have also grown exponentially, creating the danger of worsening global Marxist class struggles, as the likes of MAGA+F (and their employees) pull themselves apart in terms of income and influence from the rest of the mortals.

It is against this background that we ___discovered___ several fundamental techniques now collectively known as __Phosway__, which we hope may address the worsening class struggles, by creating the _Free Software Revolution 2.0_.


## Modifying the Contents of Any Web Page

Let us illustrate what we plan to do with PhosWeb, a component of Phosway, before continuing to explore the far reaching effects of Free Software Revolution 2.0.

A typical tutorial on web application development in 2020 may look like this:

We took a random example from the Internet to illustrate the unnecessary complications with "modern" web applicatoin development tools, when compared to PhosWeb, consisting of a collection of fundamental technologies which greatly trim the unnessary fat.

Figure 1 is the result of a web page using Microsoft's LinkedIn as template whose contents have been modified, using the data from a JSON file shown below:

This is part of a project called "MasakNet", where "Masak" is the Malay word for "cooking". The aims of this project inclulde:

- to help the people who are cooking at home (due to the current COVID19 pandemic lockdown), to sell and deliver the food to nearby customers.
- to arrange expert chefs to conduct cooking classes, online or off line, to train the people who are cooking at home.
