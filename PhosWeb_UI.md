# Search Post Chat Pay (SPCP) &mdash; 4 Essential Functions of PhosWeb

## From "No Code" Platforms to "Search Post Chat Pay": How Users and Developers may collaborate in Hybrid FOSS Start-up Ventures



1. While there have been various "no code" frameworks targeted at non-programmers to help them develop apps, they fail to address several crucial factors in making or breaking new start-up ventures:

- Most start-up ventures are not organized like a free software or open source (FOSS) project. Although FOSS sounds counter intuitive as its primary aim is not profit oriented, it is exactly because of this that we believe FOSS has some crucial elements to help reduce the failure rate of start-up ventures.

- The so called "no code" frameworks still rely on conventional database systems, where user authentication is centralized.

Centralized user authentication will continue to be one of the most critical bottlenecks of growth for new start-ups, as acquiring users or customers to register is time consuming and costly.

2. We shall describe MasakNet, to illustrate the organizational to technical issues in a "hybrid Free Software Start-up" (HFSS), beyond the conventional "start-ups using FOSS" modus operandi.

MasakNet's aims are as follow:
- to help the people who are cooking at home (due to the current COVID19 pandemic lockdown), to sell and deliver the food to nearby customers.
- to arrange expert chefs to conduct cooking classes, online or off line, to train the people who are cooking at home.
- to work with accomodation booking services like AirBnB to provide an "all-in-one" experience &mdash; from holiday to cooking class and partying.
- to provide training for everyone involved &mdash; from apprentice chef, marketing, finance, management, deliveries, investors etc.

### Legal Responsibilities in HFSS

1. One of the most fundamental questions concerning Hybrid Free Software Start-ups (HFSS) will be legal responsibilities &mdash; who will be legally responsible for the information and the operations of the projects and how will this affect users.

We may draw precedents from existing FOSS projects as well as non-profit charities and Non-Governmental Organizations.

A lack of awareness on legal responsibilities may prevent many programmers or non-programmers alike to partificipating in HFSS. As such, we feel that we should be taking more efforts in educating everyone on this issue.

集思广益 synergy maximises success

The first issue that we may explore is:

- How do users make sure the information displayed on PhosWeb is genuine?
  - e.g. Experience concerning a Chef?

To be practical, Pareto's principle would need to be applied on many stages of operations of PhosWeb, as we envisage it will be run on a voluntary basis.

Consider Scenario A:
- Chef Mr. P posts on PhosWeb to run a cooking class on DD MM YYYY location KL-001.
- A user of PhosWeb cross posts this to Facebook group Malaysian Chef Connection and receives no complaints.
- Chef P is most likely genuine.
- The cooking class proceeds without issues.

## Total Transparency & Absolute Privacy

The asymmetric cryptographic alogrithms that powered PhosWeb both total transparency and absolute privacy for users, two seemingly mutually exclusive features.

By "absolute privacy", it means that a User is identified by a public key that is generated randomly during a particular session (transient key cryptography). He (or she) may choose to reveal his identity in the real world at his own discretion.

By "total transpaency", it means that since each public key is (theoretically) unique at a given time (it is nearly impossible for 2 users to generate the same public key at the same time within a connected system, with a small number (<10,000) of total users), every transaction is witnessed by at least 2 users, and as such, the transaction can be logged (if both parties agree).





3. May need to create a foundation like Free Software Foundation to govern HFSS.

4. "Usedev": User + Developer
