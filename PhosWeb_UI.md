## From "No Code" Platforms to "Search Post Chat Pay": How Users and Developers may collaborate in Hybrid FOSS Start-up Ventures

While there have been various "no code" frameworks targeted at non-programmers to help them develop apps, they fail to address several crucial factors in making or breaking new start-up ventures:

- Most start-up ventures are not organized like a free software or open source (FOSS) project. Although FOSS sounds counter intuitive as its primary aim is not profit oriented, it is exactly because of this that we believe FOSS has some crucial elements to help reduce the failure rate of start-up ventures.

- The so called "no code" frameworks still rely on conventional database systems, where user authentication is centralized.

Centralized user authentication will continue to be one of the most critical bottlenecks of growth for new start-ups, as acquiring users or customers to register is time consuming and costly.

We shall describe MasakNet, to illustrate the organizational to technical issues in a "hybrid FOSS Start-up" (HFOSS), beyond the conventional "start-ups using FOSS" modus operandi.

MasakNet's aims are as follow:
- to help the people who are cooking at home (due to the current COVID19 pandemic lockdown), to sell and deliver the food to nearby customers.
- to arrange expert chefs to conduct cooking classes, online or off line, to train the people who are cooking at home.
- to work with accomodation booking services like AirBnB to provide an "all-in-one" experience &mdash; from holiday to cooking class and partying.
- to provide training for everyone involved &mdash; from apprentice chef, marketing, finance, management, deliveries, investors etc.

### Legal Responsibilities in HFSS

One of the most fundamental questions concerning Hybrid Free Software Start-ups (HFSS) will be legal responsibilities &mdash; who will be legally responsible for the information and the operations of the projects and how will this affect users.

We may draw precedents from existing FOSS projects as well as non-profit charities and Non-Governmental Organizations.

A lack of awareness on legal responsibilities may prevent many programmers or non-programmers alike to partificipating in HFSS. As such, we feel that we should be taking more efforts in educating everyone on this issue.
