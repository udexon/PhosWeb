# PhosWeb: ONE Script, NO Brackets
- Web Programming WITHOUT Brackets

Phoscript, the programming language or script that powers PhosWeb, is derived from the Forth programming language, primarily a Reverse Polish Notation / Stack Machine script. The only other popular programming language that may claim to use no brackets would be LOGO, a derivative of LISP, which we consider the only worthy rival of Forth.

When we re-examine the history of programming languages, we may say that ALGOL in the 1960s started the diversification of today's programming languages. Yet it was also Dijkstra's now legendary report about the Shunting Yard Algorithm (DSYA), which may have influenced Charles H. Moore while designing Forth &mdash; although Moore's own admission to this fact, or the contrary, may have been lost or buried in the myraid digital archives of yesteryears.

Although "brackets in programming languages" may sound like a hard core theoretical computer science undergraudate assignment, we believe it DOES have huge practical relevance, as Phoscript was designed to be implemented as a shell script WITHIN ANY KNOWN programming language, i.e. to serve as a ___UNIVERSAL INTERFACE SCRIPT___ to ___ANY KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE___.

We may even say that the emergence of Phoscript (or similar systems with any other names) is a mathematical inevitability, that was started by ALGOL in 1960s, as almost all programming languages invented since employ some form of stack machines. As such, it is just a matter of time when someone employs the Reverse Polish Notation to directly or indirectly manipulate the stack machine that serves as the interpreter engine of a programming language.

The primary intention of this article is to impress readers who are programmers or non-programmers alike, that Phoscript is a very simple script to learn, much like the LOGO programming language, and yet, it has tremendous benefits, as we have illustrated in a previous article, how Phoscript can be used to ___MODIFY THE CONTENTS OF ANY WEB PAGE___, filling them with contents from a __Decentralized Graph Database &mdash; PhosGraph &mdash;___.
