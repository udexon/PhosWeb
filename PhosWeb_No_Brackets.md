PhosWeb: Web Programming WITHOUT Brackets

PhosWeb: ONE Script, NO Brackets

Phoscript, the programming language or script that powers PhosWeb, is derived from the Forth programming language, primarily a Reverse Polish Notation / Stack Machine script. The only other popular programming language that may claim to use no brackets would be LOGO, a derivative of LISP, which we consider the only worthy rival of Forth.

When we re-examine the history of programming languages, we may say that ALGOL in the 1960s started the diversification of today's programming languages. Yet it was also Dijkstra's now legendary report about the Shunting Yard Algorithm (DSYA), which may have influenced Charles H. Moore while designing Forth &mdash; although Moore's own admission to this fact, or the contrary, may have been lost or buried in the myraid digital archives of yesteryears.

Although "brackets in programming languages" may sound like a hard core theoretical computer science undergraudate assignment, we believe it DOES have huge practical relevance, as Phoscript was designed to be implemented as a shell script WITHIN ANY KNOWN programming language, i.e. to serve as a ___UNIVERSAL INTERFACE SCRIPT___ to ___ANY KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE___.
